GraphLCD base package Revision History
--------------------------------------

2005-04-XX: Version 0.1.2-pre6
- split off drivers from graphlcd plugin to GraphLCD driver library
  (libglcddrivers)
- split off graphics and font handling from graphlcd plugin to GraphLCD
  graphics library (libglcdgraphics)
- split off tools from graphlcd plugin to GraphLCD base package
- almost completely rewritten graphics and font handling
- added configuration file to hold the driver-specific options
- changed driver interface
- adopted the tools' code to use the new driver and graphics API
- glcddrivers: new driver noritake800 for Noritake 800(A) series
  displays (thanks to Lucian Muresan)
- glcdgraphics: fixed a NULL-pointer exception in cBitmap::DrawCharacter
  when skipPixels is equal to width of the character and SubBitmap
  returns NULL, which was not tested for (thanks to Malte Schröder for
  reporting this one)
- glcdgraphics: fixed a wrong return value in cBitmap::DrawCharacter in
  case skipPixels > 0 which prevented scrolling from working right.
- now compiles with gcc 2.95 and gcc 3.x
- added missing #includes
- new tool showtext: allows showing a text on the LCD, see
  README.showtext for details.
- glcddrivers: fixed a too early port release in sed1330 driver (thanks
  to Matthias Huber)
- glcddrivers: sed1330: added missing horizontal scrolling
  initialization. Now, there should be no displaced display any longer.
  (thanks to Wolfgang Astleitner)
- glcddrivers: Now serdisplib is loaded dynamically using libdl. So, no
  INCLUDE_SERDISPLIB define is needed any longer (thanks to Wolfgang
  Astleitner)
- glcddrivers: fixed gu256x64-3900 driver: Now sizes other than 256x64
  should work. (thanks to Detlef Ruge and Ralf Müller)
- glcdgraphics: fixed a bug in cBitmap::DrawText that prevented scrolling
  from working.
- glcdgraphics: fixed a bug in cBitmap::SubBitmap.
- glcdgraphics: changed the interface of DrawText and DrawCharacter of
  cBitmap class.
- glcdgraphics: extended font attributes to better support converted true
  type fonts. Also changed font file format to support this attributes.
- glcdgraphics: the lastChange attribute of cImage now is 64 bits wide.
- crtfont: extended it to support the new font attributes
- crtfont: changed file format of description files. Now the font
  attributes are given by its names, p. e. lineheight:20. Look in
  README.crtfont for details.
- new tool genfont: allows converting of true type fonts to GraphLCD
  fonts using freetype2 library. You have to uncomment HAVE_FREETYPE2 in
  Make.config to use it.
- added new fonts verdana and verdana bold in sizes 9 to 29 converted by
  genfont.
- glcdgraphics: Added additional type casts to std::min calls to make it
  compile on x86-64 (thanks to Stefan Bergler).
- glcddrivers: fixed a bug in serdisp.c. When using direct IO the port
  string was truncated (thanks to Stefan Bergler).
